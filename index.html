    <big>A formal computer language that includes a controlled vocabulary and set of grammatical rules designed to
        instruct a computer how to perform specific tasks.
        <br><b>Programming languages</b> are used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express
        algorithms.
        A programming language is mainly used to develop desktop applications, websites, and mobile applications.</big>

  <h2 style="text-align: left;">1. Low Level programming language</h2>
   
    <big> Low-level language is machine-dependent (0s and 1s) programming language. The processor runs low- level
        programs
        directly without the need of a compiler or interpreter, so the programs written in low-level language can be run
        very fast.</big>

        <h2 style="text-align: left;">2. High Level Language</h2>
   
    <big style="text-align: right;"> High-level programming language (HLL) is designed for developing user-friendly software programs and websites.
        This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into machine language
        (execute the program). <br>

        The main advantage of a high-level language is that it is easy to read, write, and maintain. <br>

        High-level programming language includes <b>Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Objective C, Cobol, Perl,
            Pascal, LISP, FORTRAN, and Swift </b> programming language.</big>
            <br>
    <br>
    
        A high-level language is further divided into two parts :-
        <br>
        <br>
            
         <big>
            i. Procedural Oriented programming language 
            <br> ii. Object-Oriented Programming language
         </big>

     </big>
    <br>
    <h2 style="text-align:left">3. Middle-level programming language</h2>
    

    <big>Middle-level programming language lies between the low-level programming language and high-level programming
        language. It is also known as the intermediate programming language and pseudo-language.

        A middle-level programming language's advantages are that it supports the features of high-level programming, it
        is a user-friendly language, and closely related to machine language and human language. <b>Example: C, C++, language.</b></big>

<big style="text-align:right;"><i> The first computer programming language was created in 1883, when a woman named Ada Lovelace worked with
    Charles Babbage
    on his very early mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine.
    While Babbage was concerned with simply computing numbers, Lovelace saw that the numbers the computer
    worked with could represent something other than just amounts of things. She wrote an algorithm for
    the Analytical Engine that was the first of its kind. Because of her contribution, Lovelace is
    credited with creating the first computer programming language.

        " target="_blank">HISTORY</a></h1> </u>
    
    As different needs ha-ve arisen and new devices have been created, many more languages have followed.Most
    computer programming languages were inspired by or built upon concepts from previous computer programming
    languages.

    <big><i>Today, while older languages still serve as a strong foundation for new ones, newer
        computer programming languages make programmers’ work simpler. Businesses rely heavily on programs to
        meet all of their data, transaction, and customer service needs. Science and medicine need accurate
        and complex programs for their research. Mobile applications must be updated to meet consumer demands.
        And all of these new and growing needs ensure that computer programming languages, both old and new,
        will remain an important part of modern life.</i></big>
